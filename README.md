# Koala Plot Samples

This repository houses samples demonstrating the use and features of Koala Plot libraries.

Try out
the [web version of the samples](https://koalaplot.github.io/koalaplot-samples/wasmJs/productionExecutable/index.html)
for a quick look at
the possibilities when using Koala Plot. Note that this uses
the [alpha Kotlin wasm Compose web-canvas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/wasm-overview.html) capability, and you'll
need a browser supporting the [wasm garbage collection feature](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc). For more information
see [https://kotl.in/wasm_help](https://kotl.in/wasm_help).
